# 🚗📊 Car Sales & Service Analytics — Excel + Cognos Dashboards

*A data-driven ride through dealership performance & customer insights*

Welcome to my **Car Sales & Service Analytics** project — a two-part analytics showcase built using **Excel for the Web** and **IBM Cognos Analytics**.
This project transforms raw automotive sales and service data into clean, interactive, insight-rich dashboards designed to support business decisions across dealership operations.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

As a regional manager for a network of car dealerships (in this simulation), the goal was simple:
**Turn complex data into clear visuals** that answer key business questions about sales, profits, model performance, recalls, and customer sentiment.

This repository contains:

### ✔ Excel KPI Dashboards

Created as part of the IBM Excel course — focusing on sales trends, dealer performance, and profit analysis.

### ✔ Cognos Analytics Dashboards

A visual analytics dashboard with two tabs — **Sales** and **Service** — built using the Auto Group Data Module.

Both dashboards together form a complete analytics portfolio piece demonstrating data visualization, KPI interpretation, and dashboard design.
